    "adjusted_passage": "Creating random paragraphs is an excellent method for authors to ignite their imagination early in the day. Because the subject of the paragraph is unpredictable in advance, the writer needs to think innovatively to tackle one of three typical tasks. They might employ the random paragraph as the beginning of a brief narrative and develop it further. Alternatively, they could insert the paragraph into the center of an ongoing tale. The last possibility is to use the random paragraph as the ending of a short story. Regardless of the chosen task, the author must utilize creativity to seamlessly integrate the paragraph into their composition.",
